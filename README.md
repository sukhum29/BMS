# Online Banking System

This is a simple Python script for an online banking system. The script allows users to create bank accounts, log in, manage balances, transfer money, and request loans. It uses MySQL as the database for storing loan and account information.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Python**: You need Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **MySQL Database**: Ensure you have a MySQL database server set up. Create a database named `project` for this script, or adjust the database name in the script to match your setup.

3. **Python Packages**: Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install mysql-connector-python
   ```

## Configuration

Before running the script, you need to configure the database connection settings. Open the script and modify the following lines to match your MySQL server details:

```python
conn = mysql.connector.connect(host='localhost', user='root', password='your_password', auth_plugin='mysql_native_password')
```

Replace `'your_password'` with your MySQL root password.

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```
python online_banking.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to create a new bank account or log in to an existing account. You can perform various banking operations such as managing balances, transferring money, and requesting loans.

## Note

- This script is intended for educational and demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you should implement proper security measures, user authentication, and error handling.

- Ensure you have proper backups of your MySQL database before running the script.

- The script might need additional customization and improvements to meet specific requirements.
